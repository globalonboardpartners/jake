The Portuguese first settled the area of Accra in 1482 and developed it into a colony.

In the mid-19th century, Portuguese influence in the region began to wane, and the west coast of Africa came under British domination, and a plan was formed for the future growth of Accra.

The Dutch began accessing the island’s salt ponds in the early 1600s. In 1648, France and the Dutch Republic divided the island into two territories by signing the Treaty of Concordia. While the border is open, there are distinct differences in architecture, cuisine, and culture when the imaginary line is crossed.
